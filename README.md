# pay265 — Malawi Marketplace (Vercel + Supabase)

This is a **ready-to-deploy** React (Vite) + Tailwind app connected to **Supabase** for auth and database.
It includes:
- Buyer & Seller accounts (Supabase Auth)
- Seller Dashboard to add products
- Product list with **Malawi Kwacha (MWK)** prices
- Malawi’s 28 **districts**
- Buyer flow to choose **Meet in person / Via transaction / Seller sends**

---

## 1) Local Setup (optional)
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
Create a `.env` (or set in Vite) with:
```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your-url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

---

## 2) Supabase setup (copy/paste these SQL statements)
In Supabase → **SQL Editor**, run:

```sql
-- Products table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS products (
  id bigint GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
  title text NOT NULL,
  price_mwk integer NOT NULL,
  seller_name text,
  district text,
  status text DEFAULT 'available',
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);

-- Orders table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS orders (
  id bigint GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
  product_id bigint REFERENCES products(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
  buyer_name text,
  method text CHECK (method in ('meet','transfer','delivery')),
  status text DEFAULT 'pending',
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);
```

> You can add Row Level Security later. For MVP we keep it open for simplicity.

---

## 3) Deploy to Vercel
1. Push this folder to a **GitHub repo** (public).
2. In Vercel → **New Project** → Import your repo.
3. Add **Environment Variables**:
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` = your Supabase Project URL
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` = your Supabase Anon Public Key
4. Click **Deploy** → Your site goes live.

---

## 4) How to use
- **Seller**: Sign up → go to *Seller* tab → add product (title, MWK price, district).
- **Buyer**: Sign up → browse products on *Home* → choose method (*meet*, *transfer*, *delivery*) and click **Buy** (creates an order record).

> Payments are **not** processed inside the app (MVP). Use mobile money/bank externally or extend later with a provider.

---

## Notes
- Styling uses Malawi colors (black, red, green) via a gradient header and themed buttons.
- Images are stubbed as “No Image” blocks — you can extend with Supabase Storage later.
- This is intentionally simple so you can get live quickly.
